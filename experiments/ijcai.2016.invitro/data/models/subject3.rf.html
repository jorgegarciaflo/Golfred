<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> Where was I? I was in Ivan's cubicle, I was visiting different points, the first one was at the Computer Science Department sign.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Then I couldn't get into Ernesto Bribiesca's cubicle because it was closed and obviously I couldn't move the bottle.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Then I went into the office but  this time it was Ivan's, but as it was open I couldn't know exactly if it was Ivan's, I knew it because Ivan's was there.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> I read the poster, I couldn't understand much of the poster, I needed like more time to analyze it, but it was something that had to do with how similar is a text based on its semantic aspect.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> I took Jorge's water bottle and I left it on Ivan's, what was on the desk was Ivan's computer, there was his cell phone, the email that was in Ivan's computer, I think it was about being told that they had accepted his paper.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Then I went to the meeting room and what I saw was that it was a meeting of the Golem group, there was Ivan pointing out something on the board.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Then I saw that the meeting room was busy, but then I realized that there was a Golem meeting.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Then I got to the lab.</a>
