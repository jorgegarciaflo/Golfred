<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> After I moved to the cubicle of Dr. Bribiesca but the door was locked, so I couldn't do the activity I was asked to do.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Then I went to Ivan's cubicle and when I found the point I read the poster, it was about Random Forest Regression for word alignment with semantic similarity, as I understood.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Then I turned to go to Ivan's desk and what was was on Ivan's desk was a laptop, a computer, a monitor, many paper sheets, a backpack, a cup, a little metal sheepâ€¦ several things like cables and so on.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> I went out and walked into the meeting room, in the meeting room there was Ivan pointing at the projector screen.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> As it was busy, I noticed who was it or who was using the meeting room and it said GOLEM PROJECT from 4 to 5 if I remember correctly.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Then I left and went into the lab.</a>
