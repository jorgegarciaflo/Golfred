First I went past the bathroom, I saw the sign saying that it was the Computer Science Department and the range of cubicles in the department.
Then I went to Ernesto Bribiesca’s cubicle, it was shut so I couldn’t pick up the water nor move the bottle.
After that I got into Ivan Meza’s cubicle, I read the SOPA poster and I took the water that was on the desk, I left it again and I saw on the desktop a computer with keyboard, mouse, a portrait, speakers.
After that I  went to the meeting room, where I found one person presenting, the room was busy, there was a Golem’s project meeting, and finally I got to the lab.
