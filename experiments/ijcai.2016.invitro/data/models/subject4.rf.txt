First I went to Point 1, there was a sign saying COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.
Then what did I do? Ah, the I went to Ernesto Bribiesca’s cubicle and I couldn’t got in because it wasn’t open, I knocked and it wasn't open neither.
Then I went to Ivan’s office and I read a poster talking about a model to find semantic textual similarity and well, it said that they did it with a neural network or something like that, something about forest, I don’t remember what is it, and everything was OK with their experiment and well, basically that’s it.
They did it with a French university and that’s all I can remember.
Then I went to the desk, no, I took the water bottle which was on the desk under the poster and I went to Ivan’s desk which is right around where the glass of water was, or rather behind where the glass of water was, and then I saw a computer, a laptop that had Linux, there was code in the laptop and a paper on the right and there was a mouse on the desk, a keyboard no one is using, a Samsung monitor, several papers and that’s all I can remember there.
And then I left and I went to the next point which is the meeting room and the point 6 was on the table of the meeting room, it was a long, oval table and Ivan was pointing out something on the board and then it said that if the meeting room was empty then I had to check, oh I’m sorry, if the meeting room was full I had to check what the meeting was about and the meeting said GOLEM from 5 to 7pm.
An then it said that I should come to the lab, so I came.
