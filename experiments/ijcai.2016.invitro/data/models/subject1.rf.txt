Well I started the tour almost at the entrance of the department, where there was a sign saying COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.
After I moved to the cubicle of Dr. Bribiesca but the door was locked, so I couldn't do the activity I was asked to do.
Then I went to Ivan’s cubicle and when I found the point I read the poster, it was about Random Forest Regression for word alignment with semantic similarity, as I understood.
Then I turned to go to Ivan’s desk and what was was on Ivan’s desk was a laptop, a computer, a monitor, many paper sheets, a backpack, a cup, a little metal sheep… several things like cables and so on.
I went out and walked into the meeting room, in the meeting room there was Ivan pointing at the projector screen.
As it was busy, I noticed who was it or who was using the meeting room and it said GOLEM PROJECT from 4 to 5 if I remember correctly.
Then I left and went into the lab.
