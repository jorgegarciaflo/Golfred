<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> First I went to Point 1, there was a sign saying COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Then what did I do? Ah, the I went to Ernesto Bribiesca's cubicle and I couldn't got in because it wasn't open, I knocked and it wasn't open neither.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Then I went to Ivan's office and I read a poster talking about a model to find semantic textual similarity and well, it said that they did it with a neural network or something like that, something about forest, I don't remember what is it, and everything was OK with their experiment and well, basically that's it.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> They did it with a French university and that's all I can remember.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Then I went to the desk, no, I took the water bottle which was on the desk under the poster and I went to Ivan's desk which is right around where the glass of water was, or rather behind where the glass of water was, and then I saw a computer, a laptop that had Linux, there was code in the laptop and a paper on the right and there was a mouse on the desk, a keyboard no one is using, a Samsung monitor, several papers and that's all I can remember there.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> And then I left and I went to the next point which is the meeting room and the point 6 was on the table of the meeting room, it was a long, oval table and Ivan was pointing out something on the board and then it said that if the meeting room was empty then I had to check, oh I'm sorry, if the meeting room was full I had to check what the meeting was about and the meeting said GOLEM from 5 to 7pm.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> An then it said that I should come to the lab, so I came.</a>
