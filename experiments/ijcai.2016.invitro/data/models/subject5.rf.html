<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> On the first point, where the list tells me to stop, I saw an sign in English saying COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT, it had an errorâ€¦ i think it was a spelling error.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Hence I turned around and look for a door that had the number 2, I knocked, I tried to open it, I couldn't, I tried to knock and see if someone opened it, I wait a bit, I heard nothing, no one opened, so I left.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> I went into Ivan's office, I saw the poster on the wall, I saw what was about, I read something about a Random Forest regression, a method they tried to use for a task of I don't know if it's like semantic textual similarity.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> It was a bit long, then I read like the titles which are bigger and I saw that they tried different proposals, I believe there was one which was better, I think it was the Random Forest one over another they tried to do another year.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> They tried to use, I didn't read well, but I think it was a corpus, a format, a corpus processing but they didn't see it was useful so they are just trying, they will see how they can use what they learned in 2015, which I think was what they did that year.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Then I noticed the desk under it, I took the bottle and I looked for the other desk, then I turned around and I saw the other number, then I knew that I had to put it there, I saw what was on the desk, I saw it was a little messy, I saw many cables, a computer was on, a telephone, a lot of papers.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> And then I went out, looked for the next number, I walked into the meeting room and and as I entered and turned forward I saw Ivan pointing out to a corner of the board.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Then it said that if the meeting room was busy, then I should look what whas in the, what was the meeting about, and as I had seen Ivan, I assumed that the room was busy, then I saw a sign saying GOLEM GROUP from 4 to 5pm, so afterwards I no longer checked the timetable, I assumed it was at that time, then I came here, to the workshop.</a>
