Where was I? I was in Ivan’s cubicle, I was visiting different points, the first one was at the Computer Science Department sign.
Then I couldn't get into Ernesto Bribiesca’s cubicle because it was closed and obviously I couldn't move the bottle.
Then I went into the office but  this time it was Ivan’s, but as it was open I couldn't know exactly if it was Ivan’s, I knew it because Ivan’s was there.
I read the poster, I couldn't understand much of the poster, I needed like more time to analyze it, but it was something that had to do with how similar is a text based on its semantic aspect.
I took Jorge’s water bottle and I left it on Ivan’s, what was on the desk was Ivan’s computer, there was his cell phone, the email that was in Ivan’s computer, I think it was about being told that they had accepted his paper.
Then I went to the meeting room and what I saw was that it was a meeting of the Golem group, there was Ivan pointing out something on the board.
Then I saw that the meeting room was busy, but then I realized that there was a Golem meeting.
Then I got to the lab.
